      <h1>Happy Birthday!</h1>
      <p>I have never written a birthday greeting from the heart but here I go. Happy Birthday! I honestly don’t know where to begin but I love and is honestly enjoying this journey with you. 💕 You are the sister I have without the relation of blood and this bond is unbreakable. Recently, while I was watching a KDrama I suddenly think about our times together bad, happy, sad, prayer, sorrow and wellbeing “but wait when did me and Jasi even became friends and I laughed cause our friendship had no timing”. You are strong, confident, outspoken, emotionally intelligent, edifying, competent, beautiful and super genuine. I really do admire you and I will say it over 100 times as needed. I Love You Jasi-ann McGregor. I pray the lord continue to bless our friendship and I pray he keeps watering your seeds because I know when he’s finish you will spur blossoms 🌸💐.</p>
